# JUCE DJ App

## Overview
This is the code for a new weekly livestream that I've been working on to show progress building a DJ app using C++ and JUCE.  I thought this would be a great way for us to learn and grow together.  Follow along on the [YouTube Channel](https://youtube.com/theaudioprogrammer)!

## Compiling
You need [JUCE 7](https://github.com/juce-framework/JUCE) to compile.  Clone or download the repository and open the .jucer file.  You may need to use the Projucer to update the paths to the JUCE libraries on your computer.
