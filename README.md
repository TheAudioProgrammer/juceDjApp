# JUCE DJ App

## Overview
This is the code for a new weekly livestream that I've been working on to show progress building a DJ app using C++ and JUCE.  I thought this would be a great way for us to learn and grow together.  Follow along on the [YouTube Channel](https://youtube.com/theaudioprogrammer)!

[Here's a rough roadmap](https://quartz-asparagus-70f.notion.site/DJ-App-in-C-JUCE-404e1459800f4b268ee70df3ee56cb40) of what I'm looking to achieve on this project.  Please feel free to make comments or suggestions!

## Compiling
You need [JUCE 7](https://github.com/juce-framework/JUCE) to compile.  Clone or download the repository and open the .jucer file.  You may need to use the Projucer to update the paths to the JUCE libraries on your computer.
